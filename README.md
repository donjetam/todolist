Introduction

Knowing how to manage time is already the start to a successful carrier or a less stressful life where management skills are every time required. Sometimes we get to many things to do simultaneously as a result of it, we forgot the most important ones. Focusing on one think, doesn’t mean you will be the best on everything you have to do, it actually makes us put on hold the most important things that we actually should always keep in mind. Before people used to write every end of the week what is left to do for the next week just so that they manage their time. Nowadays, life is becoming more and more stressful for every one of us and with the technology developing rapidly, people prefer to keep track on the things that they have to perform by using various tools connected to their phone or any type of device avoiding pen and paper as before. On this way, they may keep track on the details of their task by having and being able to access their “todolist” from any place that they go. 
First and furthermost, a to-do list is to set your mind at ease that you know what your responsibilities are. Every time we take a task or a message, we will have something to remember for us so that even if we are stressed or we have problems the list is always to remind us that today you have to keep you energy for something more. Nevertheless, we always emphasize that family is the highest priority in life but, how many of us remember things that has to do with family when we are too busy working the whole day, confronting many people and trying to always perform. A to-do list helps prevent your most urgent things from slipping. It prevents you from dropping any major task since any good to-do list will emphasize your highest priority items.
More importantly, a to-do list is not to overestimate yourself. It is basically to help you organize your week by letting you know all kind of tasks that are expected from you to be done.
